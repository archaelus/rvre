MODULE SUMMARY

	Regular Expression Functions for Strings and Binaries

DESCRIPTION

	This module contains functions for regular expression matching
	and substitution. It supports the POSIX Extended Regular
	Expressions syntax and semantics, i.e. it always returns the
	longest match.

DATATYPES
	Match = {Start,Length,MatchString}
	SubMatch = {Match | undefined}
	Start = Length = integer()

	SubMatch is a tuple containing information about the
	sub-expressions in a matching regular expression. For each
	sub-expression match information is returned or 'undefined' if
	that sub-expression is not activated. The sub-expressions are
	numbered from the left in the order of their opening '(' and
	have the same index in the SuMatch tuple.

	Flags = [Flag]
	 Flag = CompileFlag | ExecFlag
	  CompileFlag = {subexpr,bool()} | {newline,bool()}

	The compile flags are applied when a regular expression is
	compiled and will remain in effect whenever it is used, even
	if no flags are given at that time. They are:

	{newline,bool()}
	    Normally anchoring is applied to the input string as a
	    whole so ^ and $ will match the beginning and end of the
	    input string. Setting {newline,true} will modify this so
	    they match the beginning and end of a LINE within the
	    string and . matches any character EXCEPT a newline.

	{subexpr,bool()}
	    Setting {subexpr,true} will cause information about the
	    sub-expressions within a regular expression to be
	    returned. Normally this information is not kept.
	    N.B. this will slow down the execution so it is
	    recommended only to be done when this information is
	    required.

	There are currently no common execution flags.

EXPORTS

match(String, RegExp) -> MatchRes
match(String, RegExp, Flags) -> MatchRes

	Types:

	String = RegExp = string()
	MatchRes = {match,Match[,SubMatch]} | nomatch | {error,errordesc()}
	Start = Length = integer()

	Finds the longest, first match of the regular expression
	RegExp in String. It returns as follows:

	{match,Match[,SubMatch]}
	    if the match succeeded. Start is the starting position of
	    the match and Length is the length of the matching string.

	nomatch
	    if there were no matching characters.

	{error,Error}
	    if there was an error in RegExp.

best_match(String, RegExp) -> MatchRes
best_match(String, RegExp, Flags) -> MatchRes

	Types:

	String = RegExp = string()
	MatchRes = {match,Match[,SubMatch]} | nomatch | {error,errordesc()}

	Finds the first, longest match of the regular expression
	RegExp in String. This function searches for the longest
	possible match and returns the first one found if there are
	several expressions of the same length. It returns as follows:

	{match,Match[,SubMatch]}
	    if the match succeeded. Start is the starting position of
	    the match, and Length is the length of the matching
	    string.  nomatch if there were no matching characters.

	{error,Error}
	    if there was an error in RegExp.

matches(String, RegExp) -> MatchRes
matches(String, RegExp, Flags) -> MatchRes

	Types:

	String = RegExp = string()
	MatchRes = {match, Matches} | {error, errordesc()}
	Matches = [Match]

	Finds all non-overlapping matches of the expression RegExp in
	String. It returns as follows:

	{match, Matches}
	    if the regular expression was correct. The list will be
	    empty if there was no match. Each element in the list
	    looks like {Start, Length}, where Start is the starting
	    position of the match, and Length is the length of the
	    matching string.

	{error,Error}
	    if there was an error in RegExp.

sub(String, RegExp, New) -> SubRes
sub(String, RegExp, New, Flags) -> SubRes

	Types:

	String = RegExp = New = string()
	SubRes = {ok,NewString,RepCount} | {error,errordesc()}
	RepCount = integer()

	Substitutes the first occurrence of a substring matching
	RegExp in String with the string New. A & in the string New is
	replaced by the matched substring of String. \& puts a literal
	& into the replacement string. If the RegExp was compiled with
	{subexpr,true} then it is also possible to use \N (1 =< N =<
	9) to access the matching string for that sub-expression in
	New. It returns as follows:

	{ok,NewString,RepCount}
	    if RegExp is correct. RepCount is the number of
	    replacements which have been made (this will be either 0
	    or 1).

	{error, Error}
	    if there is an error in RegExp.

gsub(String, RegExp, New) -> SubRes
gsub(String, RegExp, New, Flags) -> SubRes

	Types:

	String = RegExp = New = string()
	SubRes = {ok,NewString,RepCount} | {error,errordesc()}
	RepCount = integer()

	The same as sub, except that all non-overlapping occurrences
	of a substring matching RegExp in String are replaced by the
	string New. It returns:

	{ok,NewString,RepCount}
	    if RegExp is correct. RepCount is the number of
	    replacements which have been made.

	{error, Error}
	    if there is an error in RegExp.

split(String, RegExp) -> SplitRes
split(String, RegExp, Flags) -> SplitRes

	Types:

	String = RegExp = string()
	SubRes = {ok,FieldList} | {error,errordesc()}
	Fieldlist = [string() | SubMatch]

	String is split into fields (sub-strings) by the regular
	expression RegExp.

	If the separator expression is " " (a single space), then the
	fields are separated by blanks and/or tabs and leading and
	trailing blanks and tabs are discarded. For all other values
	of the separator, leading and trailing blanks and tabs are not
	discarded. It returns:

	{ok, FieldList}
	    to indicate that the string has been split up into the
	    fields of FieldList.

	{error, Error}
	    if there is an error in RegExp.

sh_to_awk(ShRegExp) -> AwkRegExp

	Types:

	ShRegExp AwkRegExp = string()
	SubRes = {ok,NewString,RepCount} | {error,errordesc()}
	RepCount = integer()

	Converts the sh type regular expression ShRegExp into a full
	AWK regular expression. Returns the converted regular
	expression string. sh expressions are used in the shell for
	matching file names and have the following special characters:

	*
	    matches any string including the null string.
	?
	    matches any single character.
	[...]
	    matches any of the enclosed characters. Character ranges
	    are specified by a pair of characters separated by a -. If
	    the first character after [ is a !, then any character not
	    enclosed is matched.

	It may sometimes be more practical to use sh type expansions
	as they are simpler and easier to use, even though they are
	not as powerful.

parse(RegExp) -> ParseRes

	Types:

	RegExp = string()
	ParseRes = {ok,RE} | {error,errordesc()}

	Parses the regular expression RegExp and builds the internal
	representation used in the other regular expression
	functions. Such representations can be used in all of the
	other functions instead of a regular expression string. It
	returns:

	{ok, ParseReg}
	    if RegExp is correct and ParseReg is the parsed
	    representation.

	{error, Error}
	    if there is an error in RegExpString.

compile(RegExp | ParseReg) -> CompRes
compile(RegExp | ParseReg, Flags) -> CompRes

	Types:

	RegExp = string()
	CompRes = {ok,RE} | {error,errordesc()}

	Compile a regular expression or a parsed regular expression
	into an internal NFA or DFA format which can then be used in
	all the other interface functions. It returns:

	{ok, CompReg}
	    if RegExp or ParseReg is correct and CompReg is the
	    compiled representation.

	{error, Error}
	    if there is an error in RegExp.

format_error(ErrorDescriptor) -> Chars

	Types:

	ErrorDescriptor = errordesc()
	Chars = [char() | Chars]

	Returns a string which describes the error ErrorDescriptor
	returned when there is an error in a regular expression.

Regular Expressions

	The regular expressions allowed here is a subset of the set
	found in egrep and in the AWK programming language, as defined
	in the book, The AWK Programming Language, by A. V. Aho,
	B. W. Kernighan, P. J. Weinberger. They are composed of the
	following characters:

	c
	    matches the non-metacharacter c.
	\c
	    matches the escape sequence or literal character c.
	.
	    matches any character.
	^
	    matches the beginning of a string.
	$
	    matches the end of a string.
	[abc...]
	    character class, which matches any of the characters
	    abc... Character ranges are specified by a pair of
	    characters separated by a -.
	[^abc...]
	    negated character class, which matches any character
	    except abc....
	r1 | r2
	    alternation. It matches either r1 or r2.
	r1r2
	    concatenation. It matches r1 and then r2.
	r+
	    matches one or more rs.
	r*
	    matches zero or more rs.
	r?
	    matches zero or one rs.
	(r)
	    grouping. It matches r.

	The escape sequences allowed are the same as for Erlang strings:

	\b
	    backspace
	\f
	    form feed
	\n
	    newline (line feed)
	\r
	    carriage return
	\t
	    tab
	\e
	    escape
	\v
	    vertical tab
	\s
	    space
	\d
	    delete
	\ddd
	    the octal value ddd
	\c
	    any other character literally, for example \\ for
	    backslash, \" for ")

	The following examples define Erlang data types:

	Atoms     [a-z][0-9a-zA-Z_]*

	Variables [A-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]*

	Floats    (\+|-)?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+((E|e)(\+|-)?[0-9]+)?


	Regular expressions are written as Erlang strings when used
	with the functions in this module. This means that any \ or "
	characters in a regular expression string must be written with
	\ as they are also escape characters for the string. For
	example, the regular expression string for Erlang floats is:

	"(\\+|-)?[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+((E|e)(\\+|-)?[0-9]+)?".

	It is not really necessary to have the escape sequences as
	part of the regular expression syntax as they can always be
	generated directly in the string. They are included for
	completeness and can they can also be useful when generating
	regular expressions, or when they are entered other than with
	Erlang strings.
